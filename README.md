## Hi there 👋

I recently graduated with an M.Sc. degree in data engineering from the Technical University of Munich. While I spent most of my studies in Munich, I have been working as a deep learning student researcher in medical imaging since the end of 2023 in Boston.

Prior to Boston, I worked at Prof. Matthias Niessner's visual computing lab, where I published a paper at BMVC.

During my undergraduate studies, I spent most of my time building web scrapers and applications for the web and desktop, where I worked as an intern and co-founder of a small SaaS.

Overall, I am experienced in both deep learning research and full-stack development.

I am looking for a full-time software/machine learning/data/research engineering position - feel free to reach out if you know of any open positions :).
