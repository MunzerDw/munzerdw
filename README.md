## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in May 2024 with a M.Sc. degree in data engineering from the Technical University of Munich. While I spent most of my studies in Munich, I worked at the end of 2023 for one year as a deep learning student researcher in medical imaging in Boston. There, I published a paper at MICCAI2024.

Prior to Boston, I worked at Prof. Matthias Niessner's visual computing lab, where I published a paper at BMVC2023.

During my undergraduate studies, I spent most of my time building web scrapers and applications for the web and desktop, where I worked as an intern and co-founder of a small SaaS.

I am currently working as an AI software engineer at [ept.ai](ept.ai) in San Fransisco.
